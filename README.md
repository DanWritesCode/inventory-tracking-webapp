# Shopify Summer 2022 Intern Challenge

Frontend + Backend of an inventory/item tracking system.

# Installation Instructions

### 0) Ensure Node.JS and NPM (node package manager) are installed on the system
### 1) Download/clone this repository & extract if needed
### 2) Go to the "backend" folder, open a command line, and type:
`npm install`

This will install the neccassary dependencies.

### 3) Launch the node.js backend API application
Type `node app.js` in the command line.

The SQLite database file is automatically created in the same folder.

### 4) Go to the frontend folder, and open the index.html file with a browser
Alternatively, copy the frontend folder to a web server such as IIS, Apache, or Nginx, and open the index.html through the web server.
Either way should work :)

(note: the API server does not host the frontend/HTML)

### 5) Use the app from the browser
